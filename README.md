# Course Predictor using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict a suitable course for a student based on their interests using machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

## Introduction

Many students face the dilemma of choosing the right course for their higher education. This project provides a solution by analyzing the student's interests and predicting the most suitable course for them.

## Features

- Input up to 5 interests of the student.
- Predicts the course using three different machine learning algorithms.
- Supports a wide range of courses.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Dataset

The project uses two datasets:
- Training Dataset: Contains labeled data for training the machine learning models.
- Testing Dataset: Used to evaluate the accuracy of the trained models.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
